📝 What is Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language used for:

README files

Documentation

Blogging platforms


👉 Good Practice: Markdown is best for human-readable + simple formatting. Avoid using it for very complex layouts (use HTML/CSS instead).


---

🔠 Headings

Use # for headings. More # = smaller heading.

# H1 Heading  
## H2 Heading  
### H3 Heading  
#### H4 Heading

Preview:

H1 Heading

H2 Heading

H3 Heading

H4 Heading

👉 Good Practice:

Use only one H1 (project title).

Keep hierarchy logical (H2 → H3 → H4).

Don’t skip heading levels.

📄 Paragraphs & Line Breaks

Paragraphs = blank line separation.
Line breaks = two spaces at end of line.

This is first paragraph.  

This is second paragraph.  
Line 1.  
Line 2 (same paragraph, forced break).

👉 Good Practice: Use paragraphs for clarity. Avoid writing big chunks of text without breaks.

✍️ Text Formatting

Style	Syntax	Example Output

Bold	**bold**	bold
Italic	*italic*	italic
Bold+Italic	***text***	text
	~~strike~~	
Inline code	`code`	code


👉 Good Practice:

Use bold for emphasis.

Use italic for quotes or highlighting.

Don’t overuse formatting — keep text readable.
