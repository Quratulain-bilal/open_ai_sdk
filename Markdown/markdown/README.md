## What is Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to write formatted text using plain text syntax.  
It's widely used for README files, documentation, and blogging.

---

## Headings

Create headings using `#` symbols. The level is determined by the number of `#`.

Heading 1 - largest, usually project title
Heading 2 - section title
Heading 3 - subsection
text

**Best Practice:**  
Use heading levels logically to organize content and improve readability.

---

## Paragraphs and Line Breaks

Write paragraphs separated by one or more blank lines.

For a line break (new line without paragraph), end a line with two or more spaces and press Enter.

This is the first paragraph.

This is the second paragraph.
Same paragraph but new line because of two spaces.
