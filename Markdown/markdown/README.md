📝 What is Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language used for READMEs, blogs, and docs.
It converts plain text into formatted content like headings, bold, lists, and links.

👉 Good Practice: Always use Markdown for README files because GitHub and most documentation tools support it by default.


---

🔠 Headings

Use # for headings. More # = smaller heading.

# H1 Heading  
## H2 Heading  
### H3 Heading  
#### H4 Heading

Preview:

H1 Heading

H2 Heading

H3 Heading

H4 Heading

👉 Good Practice: Keep only one H1 per page. Use ## and ### for subsections.


---

📄 Paragraphs & Line Breaks

Paragraphs are separated by blank lines.
To force a line break → end a line with two spaces.

This is first paragraph.  

This is second paragraph.  
Line 1.  
Line 2 (same paragraph, forced break).

👉 Good Practice: Do not overuse line breaks; keep paragraphs clean and readable.

✍️ Text Formatting

Style	Syntax	Example Output

Bold	**bold**	bold
Italic	*italic*	italic
Both	***bold+italic***	bold+italic
	~~text~~	
Inline code	`code`	code


👉 Good Practice: Use bold for keywords and italics for emphasis.
