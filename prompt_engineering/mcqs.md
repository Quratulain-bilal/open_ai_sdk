8. System prompts are best used to:

a) Give general background context
b) Set rules and AI’s role

d) Force AI to be creative



9. Self-consistency prompting improves accuracy by:

a) Asking the same question multiple times and aggregating answers

11. Role prompting allows AI to:

a) Predict the next word only
b) Act as a specific character or profession
c) Increase creativity by changing temperature
d) Limit Max Tokens automatically


12. What is the main difference between Top-K and Top-P?

a) Top-K uses cumulative probability; Top-P uses fixed number of words
b) Top-K uses fixed number of words; Top-P uses cumulative probability
c) Both are identical
d) Top-K is for creativity; Top-P is for factuality


13. Chain-of-thought is especially important when:

a) You want a short response
b) Tasks are simple and factual
c) The task involves reasoning or multi-step logic
d) You want JSON output



14. Zero-shot prompting is likely to fail when:

a) Task is extremely obvious to AI
b) Task requires reasoning or step-by-step logic
c) AI is trained on lots of examples
d) You want a short answer



15. Why is documentation of prompts considered best practice?

a) To improve token efficiency
b) To track which prompts and settings give desired outputs
c) To automatically improve AI’s learning
d) To increase AI creativity



16. ReAct prompting is different because:

a) It only uses Top-P = 1
b) AI alternates reasoning and actions with tools
c) It reduces Max Tokens automatically
d) It replaces zero-shot prompting



17. When converting instructions to JSON output, which technique is most useful?

a) Few-shot examples with JSON format
b) Zero-shot vague instructions
c) High temperature
d) Step-back prompting



18. High temperature + low Top-P typically results in:

a) Predictable output
b) Highly random but still somewhat focused output
c) Completely factual output
d) Very short output



19. Step-back prompting is useful because:

a) It reduces computation cost
b) It allows AI to reason from general → specific
c) It guarantees correct output
d) It only works with zero-shot prompts



20. Which is not a valid use of system prompts?

a) Define AI’s role
b) Force output format
c) Provide one or multiple examples
d) Give strict rules for behavior



21. Self-consistency is especially useful in:

a) High-stakes reasoning tasks
b) Short factual lookup tasks
c) Writing creative poems
d) Increasing Top-K


22. Role prompting + context prompting can be combined to:

a) Produce creative outputs without constraints
b) Give AI a specific role and background info
c) Automatically reduce temperature
d) Force JSON formatting only



23. What happens if Top-P = 1 and Top-K = unlimited?

a) AI considers all words in the vocabulary for prediction
b) AI considers only the top predicted word
c) AI stops predicting after 10 words
d) AI outputs random nonsense



24. Which is the most important factor to ensure AI reasoning correctness in math problems?

a) High temperature
b) Chain-of-Thought + temperature 0
c) Few-shot examples only
d) Top-K = 100



25. Few-shot prompting improves AI outputs mainly by:

a) Providing examples for AI to mimic
b) Reducing token usage
c) Automatically lowering temperature
d) Increasing randomness


26. Why might zero-shot prompts fail on complex coding tasks?

a) AI cannot code at all
b) Lack of example patterns for guidance
c) Top-P is too high
d) Temperature is 0


27. In practical prompt engineering, “action words” like Write, List, Explain are used to:

a) Control AI’s creativity
b) Explicitly tell AI what task to perform
c) Automatically format JSON
d) Limit token output
