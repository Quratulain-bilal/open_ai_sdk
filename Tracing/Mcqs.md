Q1.

If you call Runner.run() without explicitly wrapping it in with trace(...), what happens by default?

C. A root trace plus a child trace are created

Q2.

If you create a nested trace using with trace("Child", parent_id=parent.id) but the parent_id does not exist, what logically happens?
A. A runtime error is thrown
B. The SDK automatically promotes the trace to a new root trace âœ…
C. The child trace is discarded silently

---

Q4.

By default, which of the following events are NOT wrapped in spans?
A. Agent executions
B. Guardrail checks

D. LLM generations


---

Q5.

Suppose you want to combine multiple sequential Runner.run() calls into one single trace. What is the correct approach?
A. Pass group_id manually to each run
B. Wrap both runs inside with trace("workflow") âœ…
C. Set RunConfig.trace_id explicitly for each run
D. Use custom_span()


---

Q6.

Which parameter allows you to disable recording sensitive data (like LLM inputs/outputs) inside traces?
A. RunConfig.tracing_disabled
B. RunConfig.trace_include_sensitive_data=False âœ…
C. Trace.sensitive=False
D. SpanData.hidden=True


---

Q7.

If OPENAI_AGENTS_DISABLE_TRACING=1 is set in the environment, what is the behavior?
A. Tracing is disabled globally âœ…
B. Tracing is disabled only for the current run
C. Tracing is replaced with no-op spans
D. Sensitive data is hidden, but traces still exist


---

Q8.

Which of the following spans are automatically parented under a speech group span?
A. Guardrail spans
B. Transcription and speech spans âœ…
C. Handoff spans
D. Generation spans


---

Q9.

If you manually call trace.start() and trace.finish() without passing mark_as_current or reset_current, what potential problem arises?
A. The trace will not generate any spans
B. Concurrency context will lose track of the current trace âœ…
C. The trace will automatically restart at the next span
D. The SDK raises an exception


---

Q10.

Which of the following correctly describes metadata in a trace?
A. Used only for internal OpenAI systems
B. Optional keyâ€“value data attached to a trace âœ…
C. Required for parent-child linking of spans
D. Automatically filled with model settings


---

Q11.

What is the role of the TraceProvider in the tracing architecture?
A. Responsible for creating spans
B. Responsible for exporting traces to OpenAIâ€™s backend
C. Responsible for creating traces âœ…
D. Responsible for running RunConfig


---

Q12.

When using add_trace_processor(), what happens?
A. It replaces the default backend exporter
B. It adds an additional processor that receives traces alongside the default backend âœ…
C. It disables OpenAIâ€™s backend tracing
D. It disables sensitive data capture


---

Q13.

Which of the following is true for custom_span()?
A. It cannot be nested inside another span
B. It always starts a new trace
C. It allows developers to record arbitrary operations as spans âœ…
D. It is automatically created by the SDK


---

Q14.

What is the difference between trace() and custom_span()?
A. trace() creates a top-level container of spans; custom_span() creates a child operation âœ…
B. trace() always requires a parent ID, custom_span() doesnâ€™t
C. trace() is optional, custom_span() is mandatory
D. Both are equivalent, just syntactic sugar


---

Q15.

If two different traces share the same group_id, what is the purpose?
A. To merge spans from both traces into one trace
B. To logically link related traces, such as a single chat thread âœ…
C. To avoid duplicate trace IDs
D. To allow sensitive data capture across traces


---

Q16.

Which of the following is NOT automatically traced?
A. Tool function calls
B. Transcription of speech inputs
C. Manual Python logging statements âœ…
D. Text-to-speech output


---

Q17.

If an organization is under Zero Data Retention (ZDR) policy, what happens to tracing?
A. Only metadata traces are allowed
B. All tracing is disabled âœ…
C. Tracing continues but without sensitive data
D. Only custom spans are recorded


---

Q18.

What is the main difference between set_trace_processors() and add_trace_processor()?
A. set_trace_processors() adds processors, add_trace_processor() replaces them
B. set_trace_processors() replaces default processors âœ…, add_trace_processor() adds alongside existing ones
C. Both do the same
D. Neither affects backend export


---

Q19.

What is the role of contextvars in tracing?
A. To manage trace persistence across sessions
B. To track the current active trace/span automatically in concurrent execution âœ…
C. To encrypt sensitive data inside spans
D. To merge multiple group_ids


---

Q20.

When tracing non-OpenAI models with LitellmModel, how does tracing still work?
A. By disabling tracing and re-enabling manually
B. By setting set_tracing_export_api_key() with an OpenAI API key âœ…
C. By wrapping every span manually with custom_span
D. Tracing is not possible at all
